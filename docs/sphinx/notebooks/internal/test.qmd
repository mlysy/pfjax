# Problem Statement

Here we want to define a base class which optional creates a method, i.e at runtime.  However, we want to do this in a way that the runtime method doesn't overwrite want would be done with the derived class.

# Tests

```{python}
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

def bar(self, x):
    """Optional method to create."""
    return x*x

class Base:
    """Base class."""
    def __init__(self, add_bar=False):
        if add_bar:
            if not hasattr(self.__class__, "bar"): 
                setattr(self.__class__, "bar", bar)
```

```{python}
# test that derived class with default method works
class Derived(Base):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(add_bar=True)

foo = Derived()
foo.bar(3)
```
```{python}
# test that derived class with custom method works
class Derived(Base):
    def bar(self, x):
        return x + 3

foo = Derived()
foo.bar(3)
```
```{python}
#| error: true
# test that derived class with no bar method has correct error
class Derived(Base):
    pass

foo = Derived()
foo.bar(3)
```

```{python}
#| error: true
# same as a regular class without the method
class Test:
    pass

foo = Test()
foo.bar(3)
```
