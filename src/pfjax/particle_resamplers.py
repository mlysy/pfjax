    Particle resampler.

    This basic one just does a multinomial sampler, i.e., sample with replacement proportional to weights.

        key: PRNG key.
        x_particles_prev: An `ndarray` with leading dimension `n_particles` consisting of the particles from the previous time step.

    Returns:
        A dictionary with elements:
            - `x_particles`: An `ndarray` with leading dimension `n_particles` consisting of the particles from the current time step.  These are sampled with replacement from `x_particles_prev` with probability vector `exp(logw) / sum(exp(logw))`.
            - `ancestors`: Vector of `n_particles` integers between 0 and `n_particles-1` giving the index of each element of `x_particles_prev` corresponding to the elements of `x_particles`.
